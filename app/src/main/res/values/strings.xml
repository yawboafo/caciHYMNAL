\nThe library used in this demo is available on <a href="">Github</a>.

\nThe first app published by UNCOPT was <a href="market://details?id=com.uncopt.android.filebrowser.free">Duo: Holo File Manager w/ Root (DuoFM)</a>.
It\'s a file manager that focuses on security, but also on performance and ease of use. You can read more about it <a href="http://duofm.bitbucket.org">here</a>.
Plugins for this file manager are available (for free) and are distributed as separate applications.
\nThe second app published was a small developer tools called <a href="market://details?id=com.uncopt.android.charcodes">Character Codes</a>.
It\'s an app that conveniently displays character codes and entity name.

while &#xab;&#x2009;Character&#xa0;Codes&#x2009;&#xbb; is only available as a paid app.
Since the release of those two apps, <a href="http://uncopt.com/android">new UNCOPT apps</a> have

users can show their appreciation and help out by donating a little bit of money.
